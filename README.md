Let others guess what you are drawing!

Install the addon, join a party/guild/raid group, select a fitting addon channel, and hit start.

Each member will see a chat message, giving them the opportunity to join your game. You can also give them the game id, so they can paste it and join that way (they still have to be in your party/guild/raid group).

Once everyone is present, you can start the game by hitting "start".

Each round the current host has to select one of three words, and then has 120 seconds to draw it. The others can see the drawing and must try to guess it using the chatbox at the bottom right.


TODOs:

- show chatlog above the input box

- make the interface less ugly

- enable erase

- enable multiple brush colors
